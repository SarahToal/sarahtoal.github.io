        ABOUT
      </div>

      <div class="text4">
        This book consists of various articles from the 2001-2003 E-Zine 'WARNING', which had a total of 13 issues, minus issue 10 as it was taken down because a legal threat was received. The E-Zine was created by a high-school student who refers to themselves as 'Happy' or 'Happy_Hardcor3'.
      </div>

      <div class="text4">
        The WARNING E-Zine was a mix of random articles and text, with various advertisements in between. WARNING gave high-school students an opportunity to express what they were feeling, totally anonymously. The characters met within the text shows how complex a teenage mind is, facing challenges with love, people and social issues.
      </div>

      <div class="text4">
        This book, my version of the E-Zine articles, allows us to read the text with visual elements of the current world we live. By doing this, we can see that despite the E-Zine being written in the early 2000’s, many aspects of it are still relevant today.
      </div>

      <div class="text3">
        As Happy states:-
        <br>
        ‘Consied this a Warning if you cant handle thinking alot then the best thing for you to do is close this window now or set this piece of paper down because this will be way to hard for you to handle.’
        <div class="text4">
          Enjoy reading!

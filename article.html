        Hello and welcome to the first issue of Warning magazine. Inside this zine you will find the crazy mixed-up thoughts of a few very insane High School students with higher IQ's than most High School Teachers. This first issue is really an experiment of recording extremely useless thoughts that are recorded with the sole purpose of getting people like you into a very sub-concious mind. Consied this a Warning if you cant handle thinking alot then the best thing for you to do is close this window now or set this piece of paper down because this will be way to hard for you to handle. Sincerly, The Editor, HAPPY

      </div>

      <div class="text3">
        I have seen what you have not. I have seen people starving. I have seen people dieing. I have seen people choking. I have seen smoke and fire. I have seen explosions. I have seen the good rot. I have seen the evil take over. I have seen what you dont want to see. I have seen good will turn bad. I have seen hell on Earth. I have seen the Omega. I have seen the future.If you dont all stop the hate and start to care this is what it is going to come to. The people of all colors will suffer together and you will then begin to care. That care wont matter anymore if you have waited to late. The world will end in disaster and there will be no starting over or repenting. War is in equality to hate. Murder is also in equality to hate. Don’t hate. Osama Bin Laden will get his for the people he killed God will make shure of it. Do not stoop to his level. Yes you all want revenge but revenge is not sweet. If you get revenge more innocent lives will be taken. You can’t kill a race just because of one person. Siners always get what they diserve in the end, but you to are being siners by trying to kill someone. Lives are taken for a reason. The people in New York had a reason to go. They where called, so let fate take it’s toll. God is in control.

      <div class="text3">
        I had a really sick realization about living in the capatilist country known only as the USA and some other names. The realization I had made me feel very uncomfortable about my well being in life or what small amount of life I am allowed to live.I realized that the goverment lies, they lie to all the people in the USA to please them and the people of this sick place swollow those lies and get ran over every day. I feel really bad for all these people and have thoughts wondering if any other people have trully realized the extent of the lies. For instance if a gov. official where to read this file I would probably be in a world of trouble because they have taken away the freedom of the press, especially if it makes them look bad and guess what. This makes them look really bad, but I don’t care. I decided after i made my realization I had to take some kind of a stand and well this is the stand I took. So if you don’t agree then F*!@ Off because I dont care.

We where all eating lunch and all the sudden she runs in the cafeteria with a 9mm pistol. She runs up to her ex and puts the gun against his skull. She informs him by saying, “You can either die or take me back.” The guy replies with, “Fuck You Bitch!” The girl speaks again saying, “Then your gonna die and then I am going to die too.” She pulled the trigger and it went click. The idiot forgot to load the gun. I bet she feels really stupid, being that she is sitting in a little cell now. She brought a gun into a no gun and drug area and forgot to load it. I hope the bitch rots in hell cause she scared the shit out of everyone. Dumb people are so profound sometimes.

The largest amount of them are rednecks that ride tractors foir fun and fuck goes for entertainment. Gruesome hell bound little town. I am moving to Dallas to live amongst people. People with real lives. I am going to film school to be a producer so I can show my artistic interest visually. I am currently looking for someone to do some screenwriting.

        I’m not longer going to film school my friends. Your friendly narrator is now going to major in Music and minor in Philosophy. Yes, Philosophy. The study of the human thought and reasoning processes. I am going to release an album and write a book. What the book will be about??? I don’t even know. I just know it is my manifest destiny. As I sit back and drink a Jack Daniels Hard Cola, I think of reasons why I made the sudden change. Main reason being the release of an album. I don’t know if you know or not, but your fine narrator has been working long hours writting songs for his album only so far to come up with 4 decent pieces. Maybe soon I will get another sprout of creativity and come up with something witty, but who knows?
